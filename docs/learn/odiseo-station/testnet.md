The testnet is the testing environment for the ODISEO network. Use this guide to simulate transactions on the testnet.

If this is your first time using ODISEO Station, follow the [ODISEO Station tutorial](download/ODISEO-station-desktop.md).

## Get testnet ODIS
1. Open ODISEO Station and connect your wallet.
2. In the bottom left corner of ODISEO Station, switch **Mainnet** to **Testnet**.
2. Copy your wallet address. Your wallet address will appear at the top of the ODISEO station Desktop app near your wallet name. Your wallet address will look like this: `ODISEO<random-numbers-and-letters>`
3. Open your browser and navigate to the [ODISEO Faucet <img src="/img/Faucet.svg" height="20px">](https://faucet.ODISEO.money).
4. Paste your ODISEO address in the **Testnet address** field, select ODIS, and click **Send me tokens**.

You now have funds in your Testnet wallet. Use the testnet just like you would use the mainnet. Make sure to switch back to the mainnet to make real transactions.
